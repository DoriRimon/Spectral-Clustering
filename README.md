# Spectral-Clustering
An implementation of the Spectral Clustering algorithm. <br>
This is the final project of the 0368-2161-07 Software Project course. <br>
The idea is to implement an extremely fast implemantation of the Spectral Clustering algorithm, using the C language to implement bottle-neck computations, the Python language to implement the main logic, and the CPython capabilities to combine the two
